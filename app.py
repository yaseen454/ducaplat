    st.write("""
    The core principle of this computation is based on the concept of combinations. In Warframe's free market, players have the flexibility to set their own prices for items. However, in the case of prime junk trading, a common pricing structure tends to follow the (1,1,3,4,8) distribution for different rarity tiers (bronze15, bronze25, silver45, silver65, gold).

Recognizing this, I sought to explore all possible price combinations to gain a comprehensive understanding of potential earnings from selling these items. To achieve this, I developed a Python-based solution that simulates different pricing scenarios, calculates expected returns, and provides insights using statistical measures. The tool incorporates aggregations, statistical analysis, and various decision-support metrics to offer a clear view of average potential profits from trading in prime junk.
    """)
    st.write('### What is ANOVA?')
    st.write("""
    The core process of this computation is based on analyzing the variance within and between groups. ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) helps determine if there are statistically significant differences between the means of multiple groups. In essence, we are comparing how much the data points within a group vary compared to how much the group means themselves differ from each other.

ANOVA works by calculating two types of variance:

Within-group variance: This measures the variability within each group.
Between-group variance: This measures the variability between the means of the groups.
The ratio of these variances gives us the F-statistic, which helps determine whether the differences between the group means are significant. If the between-group variance is large compared to the within-group variance, this suggests that the group means are not all the same.

I implemented this process using Python, breaking it down into key steps: calculating the mean for each group, the overall mean, and the sum of squares for both within and between groups. Finally, I used these values to compute the F-statistic and provide p-values to help interpret the results. This tool includes statistical summaries and measures to guide you in making data-driven decisions about group differences.

    st.write('### Explanation of Grouping in ANOVA')
    st.write("""
    In this ANOVA analysis, the data is grouped based on different combinations of rare prime part prices, with the primary aim of determining which combination yields the most profit. The price of the rare prime partsâ€”referred to as 'gold' itemsâ€”is particularly important because these parts tend to have the highest prices, such as 8, 9, or 10 platinum.

To better understand how different price groupings impact profit, we organize the data into various inclusion and exclusion sets based on the price of rare parts:

**All Costs:** This set includes all possible values of rare prime parts, considering every price combination from bronze to gold tiers. It serves as a baseline for comparison.

**Costs Without 9s:** This set excludes rare prime parts that are priced at 9 platinum, allowing us to evaluate profitability when parts valued at 9 are not involved in the sale.

**Costs Without 10s:** Similar to the previous group, this set excludes rare prime parts that are priced at 10 platinum. By doing so, we can assess how the absence of the most expensive parts influences profit margins.

**Costs Without 8s:** This group excludes rare prime parts priced at 8 platinum, which represents a typical mid-range price for gold-tier items. It helps identify the profitability impact when these moderately priced parts are not included.

**Costs With 8s Only:** In contrast to the previous group, this set includes only rare prime parts that are priced at 8 platinum. It isolates the effects of focusing on this price point alone.

**Costs With 10s Only:** This group includes only rare prime parts priced at 10 platinum, focusing on high-priced items to see how they drive profitability on their own.

**Costs With 9s Only:** This group includes only rare prime parts priced at 9 platinum, which typically falls between the moderate and higher ends of the pricing spectrum. We analyze how focusing on these parts impacts the overall profit potential.

The goal of these groupings is to compare how different combinations of rare item prices affect profitability. Since gold-tier items tend to make the most significant difference in overall profit due to their higher prices, even slight adjustments in which prices are included or excluded can lead to large changes in the outcome. By examining these combinations through ANOVA, we can determine which set of price strategies offers the best balance between cost and potential profit.""")
